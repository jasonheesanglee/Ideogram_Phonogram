Each character (or an alphabet) in Phonogram Based Languages such as English and Hangul, often needs other characters to contain a definition.<br>\n<br>\n**`Hypothesis`** : Ideogram-based Languages might not need special Tokenizations or Embeddings for Natural Language Processing.<br>\n<br>\nI tried to ask and discuss with the lecturers here at Year-Dream School (Data Science Bootcamp) regarding this topic.<br>\nI only had a meaningful discussion with [@Yongdam Kim](https://www.kaggle.com/emphymachine) as he and some of his friend has some (not a lot, as per he claims) experience in this field.<br>\nHe mentioned that Natural Language Processing can be easier for Ideogram-based languages, as each character in this language contains meaning, which already could be similar to embedding.<br>\n<br>\nAs I want to further research into this topic, I had to first ask ChatGPT and Google Bard to fulfill my curiosity.<br>\n<br>\n***My query was as below.***<br>\n\n> *I was

A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be [topologically ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_order), by arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions.* <br>\n\nWhat? still no clue yet, let's move on to the definitions.<br>\n\n> *A graph is formed by vertices and by edges connecting pairs of vertices, where the vertices can be any kind of object that is connected in pairs by edges. In the case of a directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex. A path in a directed graph is a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence is the same as the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence; a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge. A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph that has no cycles.*<br><br>\n\n**TL;DR** (I shouldn't though)\n\nInstead of learning it from Wikipedia, I searched Google a bit more and completely understood the concept from [StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3782987/difference-between-oriented-graph-and-directed-acyclic-graphs-dag#:~:text=Basically%20directed%20graphs%20can%20have,two%20vertices%20A%20and%20B.&text=In%20mathematics%2C%20particularly%20graph%20theory,graph%20with%20no%20directed%20cycles.)<br>\nPlease correct me if I am wrong;<br>\nBasically DAG is a graph of number of vertices connected by edges (with direction), and this edge doesn't go back but only go forth.<br> Which makes this graph a graph with direction, but not circulating.<br>\n***OH*** That is why its name is **Directed** **A**cyclic Graph!!\n\n#### HMM-based model\nBased on this [article](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/pos-tagging-using-hidden-markov-models-hmm-viterbi-algorithm-in-nlp-mathematics-explained-d43ca89347c4) by [Mehul Gupta](https://medium.com/@mehulgupta_7991), to understand the conecept of Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based model, we need to understand what ***Markov Chain*** is.<br>\nIt gave a simple definition of Markov chain and I completely got it!\n> *A Markov chain is a model that tells us something about the probabilities of sequences of random states/variables. A Markov chain makes a very strong assumption that if we want to predict the future in the sequence, all that matters is the current state. All the states before the current state have no impact on the future except via the current state.*\n\nBelow is an example the writer gave, and I believe this is just a perfect example.\n> *A Markov Chain model based on Weather might have Hot, Cool, and Rainy as its states & to predict tomorrow’s weather you could examine today’s weather but yesterday’s weather isn’t significant in the prediction.*<br>\n\nBelow are specified all the components of Markov Chains.\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1104/format:webp/1*tI5HGo_cFTxgcxiEDHQMOw.png\" height=100 />\n\nMoving on to ***HMM-based model***.<br>\n> *Sometimes, what we want to predict is a sequence of states that aren’t directly observable in the environment. Though we are given another sequence of states that are observable in the environment, these hidden states have some dependence on the observable states.*\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*EXjrDa28pUnGmI0ehjhR8A.png\" height=100 /><br>\n> *In the above HMM, we are given Walk, Shop & Clean as observable states. But we are more interested in tracing the sequence of the hidden states that will be followed which are Rainy & Sunny.*<br>\n\n***As per my understanding, simply saying, this is an advanced step after Markov Chain.<br>\nAccording to the provided image, actions are the subjects that we are predicting, and the original factors of Markov Chain example (weather conditions), are the hidden layer (state) that influences the prediction of the action.***<br>\n\nHidden Markov Model is needed for Part of Speech Tagging (Categories of words; verbs, nouns, actions, expresssions and so on).<br>\n> If you notice closely, we can have the words in a sentence as Observable States (given to us in the data) but their POS Tags as Hidden states and hence we use HMM for estimating POS tags. It must be noted that we call Observable states ‘Observation’ & Hidden states ‘States’.\n\nBelow are the specified all the components of HMM<br>\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1240/format:webp/1*ARltONawvqjzKeZOMvD-tg.png\" height=100 /><br>\n> *$Q$: Set of possible Tags<br><br>\n$A$: The A matrix contains the tag transition probabilities<br><br>\n$P$($ti$|$ti−1$) which represent the probability of a tag occurring given the previous tag. Example: Calculating A[Verb][Noun]:\n$P$ (Noun|Verb): Count(Noun & Verb)/Count(Verb)<br><br>\n$O$: Sequence of observation (words in the sentence)<br><br>\n$B$: The $B$ emission probabilities, $P(wi|ti)$, represent the probability, given a tag (say Verb), that it will be associated with a given word (say Playing). The emission probability $B$[Verb][Playing] is calculated using:<br><br>\n$P$(Playing | Verb): Count (Playing & Verb)/ Count (Verb)<br><br>\nIt must be noted that we get all these Count() from the corpus itself used for training.<br><br>\nA sample HMM with both ‘A’ & ‘B’ matrices will look like this :*\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1026/format:webp/1*TY_h8WgfRH7iJy1PZKN5UQ.png\" height=100 />\n\n> *Here, the black, straight arrows represent values of Transition matrix ‘A’ while the dotted black arrow represents Emission Matrix ‘B’ for a system with Q: {MD, VB, NN}.*<br>\n\nThe writer has also explained about Decoding using HMMs.<br>\nWhile skimming through the upcoming content (Viterbi Algorithm) of the same writer, I thought it was necessary to go through this part as well.<br>\n> Given an input as HMM (Transition Matrix, Emission Matrix) and a sequence of observations $O = o1, o2, …, oT$ (Words in sentences of a corpus), find the most probable sequence of states $Q = q1q2q3…, qT$ (POS Tags in our case)<br>\nThe two major assumptions followed while decoding tag sequence using HMMs:\n> - The probability of a word appearing depends only on its **own tag** and is independent of neighboring words and tags.\n> - The probability of a tag depends only on ***the previous tag(bigram HMM)*** that occured rather than the entire previous tag sequence i.e. shows Markov Property. Though we can be flexible with this.\n\nWhich, I believe, means unlikely to Markov Chain, it references on the previous tag, but surely, not the entire previous tags.<br>\nLet's move on to Viterbi Algorithm\n\n### Viterbi Algorithm\n[Mehul Gupta](https://medium.com/@mehulgupta_7991) has also well explained about Viterbi Algorithm from the same [article](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/pos-tagging-using-hidden-markov-models-hmm-viterbi-algorithm-in-nlp-mathematics-explained-d43ca89347c4).<br><br>\nViterbi Algorithm is a decoding algorithm used for HMMs.<br>\nThe writer mentioned that setting up Lattice, the probability matrix, is necessary.<br>\nIn prior to proceed further, being familiar with the tags of Part of Speech would be necessary.<br><br>\n\n<img src=\"https://m-clark.github.io/text-analysis-with-R/img/POS-Tags.png\" height=200 /> <br>\n[***Source: Text Analysis in R by Michael Clark***](https://m-clark.github.io/text-analysis-with-R/part-of-speech-tagging.html)<br>\n\n    \nWith a sample sentence ***Janet will back the bill***, it will look like this on Lattice:<br>\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1080/format:webp/1*8-5KZVj-_jZOWN83gGhD5A.png\" height=100 />\n\nAs all the words in this sentence are commonly used words, there are no word with an \"Unknown\" tag.<br><br>\n\nEach cell of the lattice is represented by $V_t(j)$, $V$ for Viterbi, $t$ for column, $j$ for row.<br>\nThis represents probability that the HMM is in $state j(present POS Tag)$ after seeing the $first t observations (past words for which lattice values has been calculated)$.<br>\nThis passes through the most **probable state sequence (Previous POS Tag)** $q_1, q_2, ... q_t-1$.<br>\nWhich means, if we have the word **back**, we most probably will have **Janet** and **will** in previous order.<br>\n\n$V_t(j)$ is calculated as :\n$$V_t(j) = max: V_t-1*a(i,j)* b_j(O_t)$$\nwhere we got ‘a’(transition matrix) & ‘b’(emission matrix) from the HMM part calculations discussed above.:<br>\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1014/format:webp/1*1UylhpDw7suhH9WpnPYFaw.png\" height=20 />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Main Functions\n-----------------------------------\n\n### 1.
